This can be accomplished by:\n\n```bash\ngit remote add theirUsername git@github.com:theirUsername/repoName.git\ngit fetch theirUsername\ngit checkout -b my_name_for_their_branch theirUsername/theirBranch\n```\n\n### Example\n\nFollowing directions for [Keeping your fork in sync](https://github.ibm.com/MFPSamples/DevCenter/wiki/Keep-fork-in-sync) for the DevCetner.\n\nIn this example I will be demonstrating creating a `GA` branch from `upstream`, in my local environment. I will be prefixing the remote `GA` branch with my initials to have a differentiation between the `upstream` branch and my local (forked) copy.\n\nYou can set `upstream` as the repo to follow (**userName**)\n\n```sh\ngit remote add upstream git@github.ibm.com:MFPSamples/DevCenter\n```\n\nOnce this is done your are free to `fetch` and `pull` code from the `upstream` witch is the source repo for all changes (representing another ** userName**).\n\n```sh\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/master\n```\n\n**Note:** This is assuming you are trying to merge to you local (forked) `master` branch\n\nIf you need to work off a branch that is in the `upstream` but not in your local repository (forked) you can create it with a link to upstream as follows:\n\n```sh\ngit checkout -b ENG-GA upstream/GA\n```\n\nThis line creates a local branch `ENG-GA` based on `upstream/GA`. So now you can make updates to your local repo `ENG-GA` and then push it back to `upstream/GA` which should help reduce merge conflicts. You still want to be sure to keep your local (forked) branch up to date if your changes will happen over time. Periodically you will need to merge `upstream/GA` with the following:\n\n```sh\ngit fetch upstream\ngit merge upstream/GA\n```\n\nOnce you are ready to submit your changes back to upstream you can create a pull request via [_github.com_](github.ibm.com). Ensuring that your base branch is `GA` and the head branch is `ENG-GA`.
