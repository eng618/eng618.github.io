The only difference is the oder in which you supply the\n\n```go\nxi := []int{2,3,4}\n\n// append the number 5\nxi = append(xi, 5)\nfmt.Println(xi)\n// [2 3 4 5]\n\n// prepend the number 1\nxi = append([]int{1}, xi...)\nfmt.Println(xi)\n// [1 2 3 4 5]\n```\n\n- [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/p/P-InPKinGob)\n- [Go docs](https://pkg.go.dev/builtin?utm_source=gopls#append)\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe arguments for append are a slice (first argument), and the 2nd and further\narguments are elements you are looking to append to the slice.\n\nSo for a standard append you pass it your starting slice, and then any number\nof elements you wish to append.\n\nFor the prepend, you have to pass that starting element in as a slice, you you\nhave to define the slice and type with its literal value. Then for the second\nargument you unfirl (not sure the proper term here) the slice with `...`. This\ntells go to pass in the individual values help by that slice rather than the\nslice itself.\n\n## Tools as dependencies\n\nThere is a pattern to track tools as dependencies in Go. This is used when you need tools to build your project or generate code for protos, mocks, or any other tools. This pattern is used when those tools are not imported in any files but used by the developer to build the project.\n\nThe simplest way to achieve this is to add a **tools.go** file to the root of your project. This will serve as an individual package. While the name of this package and file are not important, using a descriptive name is always helpful.\n\nIn this file you must add the go directive `// +build tools`, and then make sure all tools are listed, in the `import` section. All the tools should be prefixed with `_`, which shows that it is not explicitly imported anywhere else, but is required for the package.\n\nA simple example:\n\n```go path=path/to/project/tools.go\n// +build tools\n\npackage tools\n\nimport (\n\t_ \"github.com/path/to/some/tool\"\n)\n```\n\n<Title>Sources</Title>\n\n- [wiki walk through](https://github.com/go-modules-by-example/index/blob/master/010_tools/README.md)\n- [example project](https://github.com/go-modules-by-example/tools)\n- [How can I track tool dependencies for a module?](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-can-i-track-tool-dependencies-for-a-module)\n\n## Additional References\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink>Links</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Comparisons</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n### Links\n\n- [Go cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/go)\n- [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/)\n- [Go Play Space](https://goplay.space/) - an alternative to Go playground with syntax highlighting and inline documentation.\n\n### Comparisons\n\n#### Logging frameworks\n\n- [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)\n- [Zap: by Uber](https://github.com/uber-go/zap)\n\nThis article compares logrus with zap. <https://www.libhunt.com/compare-logrus-vs-zap>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"8f7136d45092479a22e8295f1f27116a","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":183},"frontmatter":{"title":"Go","description":"Go coding notes and reference materials"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Go\ndescription: Go coding notes and reference materials\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nThis page is a collection of tips and tricks I've come to learn about the Go programing language.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Slice: Append & Prepend</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Tools as dependencies</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Additional References</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Slice: Append & Prepend\n\nTo append and prepend you would use the same build in `append` go method.
