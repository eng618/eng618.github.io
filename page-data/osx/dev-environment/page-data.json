With `homebrew install bash`. It is also important to note that you will have to insure you **bash_profile** or **bash_rc** is updated to have the brew path first in your systems path. Once you have the updated bash installed you can install the latest bash-completion with `brew install bash-completion2`\n\nYou will need to update how you load the bash completion in your **[bash/bash_rc]profile** as follows.\n\n```shell\n####### Verify is bash_completon is installed #######\n\n # Add tab completion for bash completion 2\nif which brew > /dev/null && [ -f \"$(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion\" ]; then\n  source \"$(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion\";\n  export PS1='\\W$(__git_ps1) \\$ '\n\n# Fallback to bash completion\nelif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then\n  source /etc/bash_completion;\n  export PS1='\\W$(__git_ps1) \\$ '\nfi;\n```\n\n**Note**: you can leave out the `export` of `PS1` if you choose. I just prefer a simple concise command prompt.\n\n[bash_completion_source]: https://troymccall.com/better-bash-4--completions-on-osx/\n\n## Java Version Management\n\nWhen it comes to Java management on a Mac there are several option in which you can chose. Below I will detail a few of them to chose from. First I will mention my favorite jenv\n\n### jenv\n\nThis software is available through Homebrew. It is well documented on it's <a href=\"https://github.com/gcuisinier/jenv\" target=\"blank\">github page</a>, . Let us discus a few caveats here. First and foremost you must add any installed versions of Java installed for jenv to be able to manage it.
