Since we are using Oh My Zsh, we can install it in the **~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/** directory with the following.\n\n```zsh\ngit clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k\n```\n\nthen simply add the theme to you **~/.zsh** file.\n\n```zsh\nZSH_THEME=\"powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k\"\n# or exicute\np10k configure\n```\n\nTo include syntax highlighting of your shell install the [zsh-syntax-highlighting plugins](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) with the following:\n\n```zsh\ngit clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting\n```\n\n## Install fonts with gliphs\n\nI like to use [IBM Plex](https://github.com/IBM/plex), which is patch with powerline glyphs from [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).\n\nSee [this list](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#patched-fonts) of patched fonts to find the one you want. You can also use this [playground](https://www.programmingfonts.org/) to see the fonts quickly in a simulated code environments.\n\nOnce you have found the font you want the easiest way to install is via Homebrew, with the following command.\n\n```zsh\nbrew tap homebrew/cask-fonts &&\nbrew install --cask font-<FONT NAME>-nerd-font\n\n# example for Blex Mono\nbrew install --cash font-blex-mono-nerd-font\n```\n\n## Other plugins and customizations\n\nInstall [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls#installation)\n\n```zsh\ngem install colorls\n```\n\n## Add Aliases\n\n---\n\n## Links\n\n- [How to Configure your macOs Terminal with Zsh like a Pro](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-configure-your-macos-terminal-with-zsh-like-a-pro-c0ab3f3c1156/)\n- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"87cacd4d6b7d8a1622e79bb42e9dbda6","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":227},"frontmatter":{"title":"Terminal Setup","author":"Eric Garcia","category":"osx"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Terminal Setup\nauthor: 'Eric Garcia'\ncategory: osx\n---\n\n# Setting up your Terminal with zsh and iTerm2\n\nI'll be combining a couple different tutorials that I will like to in the footnotes.
