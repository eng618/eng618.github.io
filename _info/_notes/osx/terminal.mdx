# Setting up your Terminal with zsh and iTerm2

I'll be combining a couple different tutorials that I will like to in the footnotes.  As well as some minor differences that I have updated for my personal use.

## Installing Xcode

Ensure Xcode developer tools are installed with:

```zsh
xcode-select —-install
```

## Install Homebrew

If homebrew is not installed do so now with:

```zsh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

[source](https://brew.sh)

## Install iTerm2 via Homebrew

```zsh
brew cask install iterm2
```

## Install zsh

Make sure you have the latest zsh installed

```zsh
brew install zsh
```

## Install Oh My Zsh

```zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Once installed install your various plugins, by adding them to the plugins array in your `~/.zshrc`.

Here are the [list of plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins) or check out the [wiki](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins)

Keep you upgrade oh my zsh with:

```zsh
upgrade_oh_my_zsh
```

## Powerlevel9k

Install [Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k) theme.  Since we are using Oh My Zsh, we can install it in the **~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/** directory with the following.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel9k
```

then simply add the theme to you **~/.zsh** file.

```zsh
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k"
```

To include syntax highlighting of your shell install the [zsh-syntax-highlighting plugins](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) with the following:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

## Install fonts with gliphs





## Add Aliases
