## Slice: Append & Prepend

To append and prepend you would use the same build in `append` go method. The only difference is the oder in which you supply the

```go
xi := []int{2,3,4}

// append the number 5
xi = append(xi, 5)
fmt.Println(xi)
// [2 3 4 5]

// prepend the number 1
xi = append([]int{1}, xi...)
fmt.Println(xi)
// [1 2 3 4 5]
```

Explanation:

The arguments for append are a slice (first argument), and the 2nd and further
arguments are elements you are looking to append to the slice.

So for a standard append you pass it your starting slice, and then any number
of elements you wish to append.

For the prepend, you have to pass that starting element in as a slice, you you
have to define the slice and type with its literal value. Then for the second
argument you unfirl (not sure the proper term here) the slice with `...`. This
tells go to pass in the individual values help by that slice rather than the
slice itself.
