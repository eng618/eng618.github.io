## When trying to install using homebrew

User does not have permission to write to **/usr/local/Cellar** and throws following error.

```bash
Error: Cannot write to /usr/local/Cellar
```

Attempting to `sudo` it refuses with following error.

```bash
Cowardly refusing to `sudo brew install'
```

You somehow have limited permissions to **/usr/local/Cellar**. Brew doesn't like to install with sudo which is why it refuses. Correct the issue with the following commands:

1. Check the permissions:

   ```bash
   ls -ld /usr/local/Cellar
   ```

2. Open them up for writing:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod a+w /usr/local/Cellar
   ```

## Bundle

Bundle is a very useful command. This command will allow you to keep a backup of all installed packages from brew into a file. That can be backed up and reinstalled on different machines, or to clean up and reset your environments.

### Creating Brewfile

To create the the **Brewfile** run the following command:

```shell
# To write to specific file
brew bundle dump --file=~/.eng/Brewfile

# To write to current working directory
brew bundle dump
```

### Installing from Brewfile

If you want to ensure you have all packages listed in your Brewfile installed, you can reinstall or do a fresh install (on a new machine) with the following command:

```shell
# Install from specific file
brew bundle --file=~/.eng/Brewfile

# Install with Brewfile in current working directory
brew bundle
```

**TIP**: if you want to overwrite an existing brew file add the `--force` flag to the above command.

### Resetting local environment

If your machine has gotten out of hand and you want to forcefully go back to only having packages listed in your **Brewfile**, you can run the following:

```shell
# Pointing to specific Brewfile
brew bundle --force cleanup --file=~/.eng/Brewfile

# Pointing to Brewfile in current working directory
brew bundle --force cleanup
```

## Housekeeping

- `autoremove`: Removes all unused dependencies.

  ```shell
  brew autoremove
  ```

- `cleanup`: cleans up cached packages and old versions of installed packages. You can use the `--dry-run` flag here to see what would be removed, before clearing is desired.

  ```shell
  # This safely removes aged cache and packages.
  brew cleanup

  # This cleans up all regardless of age.
  brew cleanup --prune=all
  ```
