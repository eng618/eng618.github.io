This cheat sheet is intended to be a quick reminder for the main concepts involved in using the command line program grep and assumes you already understand its usage. If you are new to the Linux command line we strongly suggest you work through the tutorial.

Visit the Grep and Regular Expressions page in our tutorial for a more in depth discussion on their usage.

## Basic Usage

| Command              | Description                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `egrep` or `grep -E` | Run grep with extended regular expressions.                                                                                       |
| `-i`                 | Ignore case (ie uppercase, lowercase letters).                                                                                    |
| `-v`                 | Return all lines which don't match the pattern.                                                                                   |
| `-w`                 | Select only matches that form whole words.                                                                                        |
| `-c`                 | Print a count of matching lines.<br />Can be combined with the `-v` option to print a count of non matching lines.                |
| `-l`                 | Print the name of each file which contains a match.<br />Normally used when grep is invoked with wildcards for the file argument. |
| `-n`                 | Print the line number before each line that matches.                                                                              |
| `-r`                 | Recursive, read all files in given directory and subdirectories.                                                                  |

## Regular Expressions

{/* prettier-ignore */}
| Command                                                    | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.` | A single character |
| `[abc]` | Range. ie any one of these characters |
| `[^abc]` | Not range. A character that is not one of those enclosed. |
| `(abc)` | Group these characters and remember for later. |
| `\n` | Replace n with a number. Recall the characters matched in that set of brackets.<br />May also be used to rename files or directories. |
| `|` | The logical 'or' operation. |
| `\` | In front of a character, removes it's special meaning. |

## RE Multipliers

| Command | Description                                                      |
