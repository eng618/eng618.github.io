## Modes

Vi has two modes insertion mode and command mode. The editor begins in command mode, where the cursor movement and text deletion and pasting occur. Insertion mode begins upon entering an insertion or change command. [ESC] returns the editor to command mode (where you can quit, for example by typing :q!). Most commands execute as soon as you type them except for "colon" commands which execute when you press the return key.

## Quitting

| `:x`    | Exit, saving changes                        |
| `:q`    | Exit as long as there have been no changes  |
| `ZZ`    | Exit and save changes if any have been made |

## Deleting Text

Almost all deletion commands are performed by typing d followed by a motion. For example, dw deletes a word. A few other deletes are:

| Command | Description                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `x`     | Delete character to the right of cursor |

| `D`     | Delete to the end of the line           |
| `dd`    | Delete current line                     |
| `:d`    | Delete current line                     |

## Yanking Text

Like deletion, almost all yank commands are performed by typing y followed by a motion. For example, y\$ yanks to the end of the line. Two other yank commands are:

| Command | Description           |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| `yy`    | Yank the current line |
| `:y`    | Yank the current line |

## Changing text

The change command is a deletion command that leaves the editor in insert mode. It is performed by typing c followed by a motion. For example cw changes a word. A few other change commands are:

| Command | Description                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------- |
| `C`     | Change to the end of the line |
| `cc`    | Change the whole line         |

## Putting text

| Command | Description                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `p`     | Put after the position or after the line   |
| `P`     | Put before the position or before the line |

## Buffers

Named buffers may be specified before any deletion, change, yank or put command. The general prefix has the form "c where c is any lowercase character. for example, "adw deletes a word into buffer a. It may thereafter be put back into text with an appropriate "ap.

## Markers

Named markers may be set on any line in a file. Any lower case letter may be a marker name. Markers may also be used as
limits for ranges.

| Command | Description                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `mc`    | Set marker c on this line                         |
| \``c`   | Go to beginning of marker c line.                 |
| `'c`    | Go to first non-blank character of marker c line. |

## Search for strings

| Command   | Description                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `/string` | Search forward for string              |
| `?string` | Search back for string                 |
| `n`       | Search for next instance of string     |
| `N`       | Search for previous instance of string |

## Replace

The search and replace function is accomplished with the :s command. It is commonly used in combination with ranges or the :g command (below).

| Command                   | Description                                     |

| `g`                       | Flag - Replace all occurrences of pattern       |
| `c`                       | Flag - Confirm replaces.                        |
| `&`                       | Repeat last :s command                          |

## Regular Expressions

| Command   | Description                                   |

| `\<`      | Anchor - beginning of word                    |
| `\>`      | Anchor - end of word                          |

Notes:

1. Regular expressions are case sensitive
2. Regular expressions are to be used where pattern is specified

## Counts

Nearly every command may be preceded by a number that specifies how many times it is to be performed. For example, 5dw will delete 5 words and 3fe will move the cursor forward to the 3rd occurrence of the letter e. Even insertions may be repeated conveniently with this method, say to insert the same line 100 times.

## Ranges

Ranges may precede most "colon" commands and cause them to be executed on a line or lines. For example :3,7d would delete lines 3-7. Ranges are commonly combined with the :s command to perform a replacement on several lines, as with :.,\$s/pattern/string/g to make a replacement from the current line to the end of the file.

| Command       | Description                            |

| `:$`          | Range - Last line                      |
| `:'c`         | Range - Marker c                       |
| `:%`          | Range - All lines in file              |
| `:g/pattern/` | Range - All lines that contain pattern |
