# Setting up your Terminal with zsh and iTerm2

I'll be combining a couple different tutorials that I will like to in the footnotes. As well as some minor differences that I have updated for my personal use.

## Installing Xcode

Ensure Xcode developer tools are installed with:

```zsh
xcode-select â€”-install
```

## Install Homebrew

If homebrew is not installed do so now with:

```zsh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

[source](https://brew.sh)

## Install iTerm2 via Homebrew

```zsh
brew cask install iterm2
```

## Install zsh

Make sure you have the latest zsh installed

```zsh
brew install zsh
```

## Install Oh My Zsh

```zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Once installed install your various plugins, by adding them to the plugins array in your `~/.zshrc`.

Here are the [list of plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins) or check out the [wiki](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins)

Keep you upgrade oh my zsh with:

```zsh
upgrade_oh_my_zsh
```

## Powerlevel10k

Install [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#oh-my-zsh) theme. Since we are using Oh My Zsh, we can install it in the **~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/** directory with the following.

```zsh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k
```

then simply add the theme to you **~/.zsh** file.

```zsh
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
# or exicute
p10k configure
```

To include syntax highlighting of your shell install the [zsh-syntax-highlighting plugins](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) with the following:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

## Install fonts with gliphs

I like to use [IBM Plex](https://github.com/IBM/plex), which is patch with powerline glyphs from [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

See [this list](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#patched-fonts) of patched fonts to find the one you want. You can also use this [playground](https://www.programmingfonts.org/) to see the fonts quickly in a simulated code environments.

Once you have found the font you want the easiest way to install is via Homebrew, with the following command.

```zsh
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts &&
brew install --cask font-<FONT NAME>-nerd-font

# example for Blex Mono
brew install --cash font-blex-mono-nerd-font
```

## Other plugins and customizations

Install [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls#installation)

```zsh
gem install colorls
```

## Add Aliases
